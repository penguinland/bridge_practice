# Not counting this comment, this file was auto-generated by the Haskell code in
# order to be evaluated as a dealer program. It is for the situation in which
# West is dealer but passes, North opens 1NT, East passes, and South makes a
# Jacoby transfer into hearts, intending to next bid 3NT and let North have a
# choice of games. It accomplishes this by specifying the following criteria:
# - West cannot open on the Rule of 20.
# - West cannot make a weak 2 bid
# - West cannot preempt at the 3 level.
# - West cannot preempt at the 4 level.
# - North can open on the Rule of 20.
# - North has a hand appropriate for a strong 1NT bid.
# - East cannot overcall at the 2 level.
# - East cannot preempt at the 3 level.
# - East cannot preempt at the 4 level.
# - South has a 5-card heart suit.
# - South cannot make a Texas transfer
# - South cannot bid Smolen
# - South has game-going but not slam-going strength
# - South is not 5-5 or 6-6 in the majors (these are described elsewhere).
# - South has a balanced hand.
